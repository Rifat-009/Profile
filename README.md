| What to Change | Search For | Location |
|---------------|-----------|----------|
| Name | `Arafatullah Rifat` | Hero, About, Footer |
| Email | `Aryanrifat1@gmail.com` | About, Contact, Form |

| LinkedIn URL | `linkedin.com/jobs/...` | About, Contact |
| Instagram URL | `instagram.com/tawsif_tibro` | About, Contact |
| GitHub URL | `github.com/Rifat-009` | About, Contact |

### Adding/Removing Skills

Locate the `skillsData` array in the `<script>` section:

```javascript
const skillsData = [
    { 
        name: "HTML5 & CSS3", 
        icon: "file-code", 
        color: "text-accent", 
        details: "Your detailed description here...", 
        achievements: ["Achievement 1", "Achievement 2", "Achievement 3"] 
    },
    // Add more skills here...
];
```

### Adding/Removing Projects

Locate the `projectsData` array:

```javascript
const projectsData = [
    { 
        id: 1, 
        title: "Project Name", 
        category: "Category",
        description: "Project description...",
        tech: ["React", "Node.js"],
        features: ["Feature 1", "Feature 2"]
    },
    // Add more projects here...
];
```

### Adding/Removing Services

Locate the `servicesData` array:

```javascript
const servicesData = [
    { 
        title: "Service Name", 
        icon: "layout", 
        color: "text-accent",
        shortDesc: "Brief description for card...",
        details: "Full description for modal...",
        documentation: ["Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3"]
    },
    // Add more services here...
];
```

## Contact Form Setup

The contact form uses **FormSubmit.co** — a free service that requires zero API keys and no backend code.

### How It Works

1. When a visitor submits the form, the data is sent via AJAX to `https://formsubmit.co/ajax/Aryanrifat1@gmail.com`
2. **First-time activation:** FormSubmit sends a one-time confirmation email to `Aryanrifat1@gmail.com`. You **must** click the activation link in that email.
3. After activation, all future form submissions arrive directly in your Gmail inbox instantly.

### Form Features

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| Spam protection | Honeypot field (`_honey`) |
| Custom subject | `_subject` hidden field |
| Table-format emails | `_template: table` hidden field |
| No captcha | `_captcha: false` for cleaner UX |
| Loading state | Button shows spinner during submission |
| Success feedback | Green success message appears for 6 seconds |
| Error handling | Red error message with fallback instructions |

### Changing the Email Recipient

If you want to change the email address, find this line in the JavaScript:

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://formsubmit.co/ajax/YOUR_NEW_EMAIL@gmail.com', {
```

Replace `YOUR_NEW_EMAIL@gmail.com` with your desired email. You will need to re-activate with the new email.

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages (Recommended)

1. Create a new GitHub repository (e.g., `Portfolio`)
2. Push all project files:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial portfolio commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Portfolio.git
git push -u origin main
```

3. Go to **Settings → Pages**
4. Set **Source** to `main` branch, `/ (root)` directory
5. Your site will be live at `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/Portfolio/`

### Netlify

1. Drag and drop the project folder into [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)
2. Or connect your GitHub repository for automatic deployments

### Vercel

1. Import your GitHub repository in [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
2. Vercel auto-detects the static site and deploys

### Important Notes for Deployment

- **Image filenames are case-sensitive** on Linux servers. Ensure your photo is named exactly `profile.jpeg` (all lowercase).
- **Email links** must use `mailto:Aryanrifat1@gmail.com` — avoid Cloudflare's email obfuscation which can break `mailto:` links. If using Cloudflare, disable "Email Address Obfuscation" in the Scrape Shield settings.
- **FormSubmit.co** works on any hosting platform since it's an external API.

## Customization Guide

### Color Scheme

The site uses CSS custom properties via Tailwind config. To change the accent color:

```javascript
// In the <script> tailwind.config section:
colors: {
    accent: '#6366f1',        // Change this to your preferred color
    accentHover: '#4f46e5',   // Change hover state
}
```

Also update these CSS values to match:

```css
.text-gradient {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #818cf8 0%, #c084fc 100%); /* Update gradient */
}

.nav-link::after {
    background: #818cf8; /* Update underline color */
}
```

### Typography

The site uses two Google Fonts:
- **Syne** (display/headings) — Bold, geometric, modern
- **Inter** (body text) — Clean, highly readable

To change fonts, update the Google Fonts `<link>` and the `fontFamily` config.

### Animations

All animations use GSAP. To adjust timing:

```javascript
// Hero entrance
gsap.from(".hero-content > *", { 
    duration: 1,      // Speed of animation
    y: 40,            // Starting offset
    stagger: 0.1,     // Delay between elements
    delay: 0.2        // Initial delay
});

// Scroll-triggered cards
gsap.utils.toArray(".glass-card").forEach((card, i) => {
    gsap.from(card, {
        scrollTrigger: { trigger: card, start: "top 90%" },
        y: 30, 
        delay: i * 0.05  // Stagger delay per card
    });
});
```

## Performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total file size | ~45 KB (HTML only) |
| External resources | 5 CDN scripts + 2 font families |
| Render-blocking | None (all scripts use `defer` or are placed at end of body) |
| Images | 1 profile photo (optimize to <200 KB for best performance) |
| Lighthouse score | 90+ (depends on image optimization and hosting) |

### Optimization Tips
- Compress `profile.jpeg` to under 200 KB using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com)
- Add `loading="lazy"` to the profile image if you add more images later
- Consider self-hosting Tailwind CSS for production (the CDN version is ~300 KB)

## Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Profile image not showing
**Cause:** Filename mismatch (case-sensitive servers)  
**Fix:** Ensure the image file is named exactly `profile.jpeg` (lowercase)

### Issue: Email form not sending
**Cause:** FormSubmit not activated  
**Fix:** Submit the form once, then check your Gmail for the activation email from FormSubmit. Click the activation link.

### Issue: Email links showing `[email protected]`
**Cause:** Cloudflare email obfuscation  
**Fix:** In Cloudflare dashboard → Scrape Shield → Disable "Email Address Obfuscation" → Purge cache

### Issue: Social icons not rendering
**Cause:** Lucide CDN not loading  
**Fix:** The site now uses inline SVGs for social icons, so this should not occur. If Lucide icons elsewhere are missing, check your internet connection.

### Issue: Animations not playing
**Cause:** GSAP not loading from CDN  
**Fix:** Check browser console for network errors. The site degrades gracefully — all content remains accessible without animations.
